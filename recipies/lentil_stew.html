      </h2>
      <ul>INGREDIENTS
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil, plus a little extra to serve</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, finely sliced</li>
        <li>1 large red onion, finely chopped (160g)</li>
        <li>½ tbsp picked thyme leaves</li>
        <li>2 small aubergines, cut into chunks, about 5 x 2cm (420g)</li>
        <li>200g cherry tomatoes </li>
        <li>180g Puy lentils </li>
        <li>500ml vegetable stock </li>
        <li>80ml dry white wine </li>
        <li>100g crème fraîche</li>
        <li>1 tsp Urfa chilli flakes (or ½ tsp regular chilli flakes)</li>
        <li>2 tsp picked oregano leaves</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper</li>
      </ul>

      <ol>METHOD
        <li>Put 2 tablespoons of oil into a large, high-sided sauté pan and place
            on a medium high heat. Add the garlic, onion, thyme and ¼ teaspoon of 
            salt and fry for 8 minutes, stirring often, until soft and golden.\
            Tip into a bowl, leaving the oil behind. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place the aubergines and tomatoes in a bowl and season with ¼ teaspoon 
            of salt and plenty of pepper. Add the remaining oil to the same pan 
            (don’t worry about wiping it clean) and, once very hot, add 
            the aubergines and tomatoes. Fry for 10 minutes, on medium high,
            turning them often until the aubergine is soft and golden-brown and 
            the tomatoes are beginning to blacken. Return the garlic and onion
            to the pan, then add the lentils, stock, wine, 450ml of water and 
            ¾ teaspoon of salt. Bring to the boil. Lower the heat to medium and 
            simmer gently for about 40 minutes, until the lentils are soft but 
            still retain a bite.</li>  
        <li>Serve warm, or at room temperature, with a dollop of crème fraîche, 
            a drizzle of oil and chilli flakes and oregano on top.</li>
